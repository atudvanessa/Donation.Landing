            <h1>Founder/CEO</h1>
            <p>Before founding Mission in 2005, Laura Bradford spent 8 years in Africa teaching literacy programs to children and young adults. While teaching abroad, she grew frustrated over the lack of basic educational supplies necessary to ensure a proper education for her pupils. Upon her return to the United States, Bradford set out to form a nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring that the youth of sub-Saharan African communities would be equipped with the tools and resources necessary to succeed in the educational world and beyond. </p>
            <p>Since its founding, Bradford’s dream has impacted the lives of thousands of individuals. Bradford received a Lifetime Achievement Award from The Nonprofits Professionals Organization in 2015 and, in 2017, she was awarded the Nonprofit Innovation and Excellence Award by the Oregon Community Foundation. In 2019, Bradford received national recognition from the U.S. Nonprofit Coordinating Committee for her leadership and dedicated efforts toward educational equality in underdeveloped countries.
